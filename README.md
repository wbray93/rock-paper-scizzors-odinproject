# rock-paper-scizzors-odinproject
This is a rock paper scissors project from theodinproject curriculum


My goal in this project is to utilize basic fundamental javascript concepts that I have learned so far in the curriculum to create a simple rock paper scissors game that the human opponent plays against the computer. This project will teach me by its end how to implement basic functions control flow and how to implement features like keeping track of player scores.
